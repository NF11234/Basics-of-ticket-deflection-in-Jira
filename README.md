# Basics-of-ticket-deflection-in-Jira
Ticket deflection in Jira refers to the process of diverting or redirecting incoming support requests or tickets away from the helpdesk or support team. The aim of ticket deflection is to provide users with self-service options or automated solutions to address their issues without the need for human intervention.

## In Jira, ticket deflection can be achieved through various means:

Knowledge Base: By creating a comprehensive knowledge base within Jira, you can provide users with a repository of articles, FAQs, and documentation that addresses common issues or questions. Users can search and find relevant information to resolve their problems without submitting a support ticket.

Automation and Workflow: Jira allows for automation and workflow customization, which can be used to trigger predefined actions or responses based on specific criteria. For example, certain types of requests or issues can be automatically routed to relevant knowledge base articles or guides instead of creating a new ticket.

Self-Service Portals: Jira can be configured to offer self-service portals where users can access resources, guides, or request assistance through a predefined set of options. Users can explore the available options and find resolutions without creating a support ticket.

Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Jira can integrate with chatbot or virtual assistant solutions that can interact with users, understand their queries, and provide automated responses or suggested solutions. This helps users find answers or troubleshoot problems without requiring human intervention.

By implementing ticket deflection strategies in Jira, organizations can reduce the volume of support tickets handled by the helpdesk or support team. This leads to improved efficiency, faster resolution times, and a better user experience as users can find solutions on their own without waiting for support.
